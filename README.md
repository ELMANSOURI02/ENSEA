Overview
This repository contains practical works (TPs) focused on hands-on applications in the fields of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Image Processing. These TPs were completed as part of my studies at Ensea and cover various key concepts, algorithms, and real-world applications. The repository is designed for those interested in exploring foundational and advanced topics in these domains.

Each TP folder includes the necessary code, explanations, and data to understand and replicate the experiments.

TP1 - Clustering
Description: This TP provides a practical exploration of clustering algorithms, focusing on unsupervised learning techniques. Through this TP, you’ll understand how clustering can group data based on similarity without any labels, using methods like k-means.

TP2 - Bayesian Networks
Description: This TP introduces Bayesian networks, a key topic in probabilistic graphical models. It covers the basics of creating and interpreting Bayesian networks, helping to understand probabilistic relationships and dependencies between variables.

TP:Basic Image Processing - Corner and Edge Detection
Description: This TP is aimed at understanding edge and corner detection techniques in image processing. You’ll explore the application of algorithms such as Canny edge detection and Harris corner detection, foundational techniques for identifying key features in images.
